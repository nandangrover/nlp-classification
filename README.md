<h3 align="center"> NLP text classification using DeepLeaning and Ensemble Learning</h3>

## What we have built?
Ensemble Learning, transformers, summarization using unigrams and bigrams and various other text pre-processing techniques were used to great effect in building our classifiers. We have reached a maximum accuracy of 75.41% for the binary classifier, 68% accuracy for predicting client behaviour types, 62% accuracy for predicting therapist behaviour types and 89% accuracy for predicting the quality of a conversation. While the amount of data available was limited, we have tried to solve the problem of generalization by using methods such as stopwords removal, tokenization, lemmatization, dropout and early stopping. Through careful data analysis and selecting appropriate algorithms for training our models, we have built multiple classifiers to correctly predict the class of an uttered text. We have also thoroughly evaluated our models through multiple metrics of evaluation.
